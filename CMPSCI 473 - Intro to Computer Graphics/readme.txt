For my assignment I used .obj 
that I made by removing parts
of files that were given to us
for the assigment. The result
is a rather geometric and 
angular interpretation of the
assignment.

My project is unique in that:
All tiers are effected by 
random re-colourations and 
random re-speculations during
animations.

Tiers 2 and 3 are relatively 
similar but they rotate at 
different speeds.

My chosen hierarchy is as shown:

[TIER 0 * FOR DECORATION PUROSES]

[TIER 1]
-sculpt1.obj
	[DESCENDANTS 1]
	-smalldiamond.obj

[TIER 2]
-sculpt2.obj
	[DESCENDANT 1]
	-smalldiamond.obj
		[DESCENDANT 2]
		-smalldiamond.obj

[TIER 3]
-sculpt2.obj
	[DESCENDANT 1]
	-smalldiamond.obj
		[DESCENDANT 2]
		-smalldiamond.obj
